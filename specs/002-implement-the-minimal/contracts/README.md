# Contracts â€” Minimal Playable Gameplay Loop

Message schemas to extend shared protocol (additive):

- join.request.json
- join.ack.json
- runStart.event.json
- input.flap.request.json
- snapshot.event.json
- runEnd.event.json

Note: These are specification-time artifacts for planning. Implementation will mirror these under `shared/schemas/protocol/v1/` as additive updates, with contract tests validating shape.
